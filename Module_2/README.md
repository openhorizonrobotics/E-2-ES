## By the end of this module, you'll:

1. **Identify and choose a suitable microcontroller family** based on project requirements, including STM32 (Cortex-M), AVR (ATmega328), or RP2040.

2. **Understand the fundamental toolchain components** required for embedded development.

3. **Set up and work with the STM32CubeIDE.**

4. **Blink an LED on physical hardware without using Arduino-style libraries or HALs,** gaining insight into:
   - Register-level GPIO control
   - Manual peripheral setup without abstractions

5. **Become familiar with using STM32’s Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to:**
   - Configure and utilize interrupts
   - Generate Pulse Width Modulated Waves
   - Implement SPI, I2C, UART
